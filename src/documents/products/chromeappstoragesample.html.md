# Chrome app storage sample

Use chrome.storage.sync to share small chunks of data among all of your Chrome devices. To test, open this app in two different devices, both signed in with the same user.

I will release this app at Chrome App Store.

Sources of this app was converted from [webBoard](http://webboard.jit.su)
